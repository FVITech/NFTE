#Teaching Entrepreneurship

##Set up presence
* My background: CS degree, MS in finance
* I've been an entrepreneur before, started a financial consulting business. Got out of it, just wasn't a fit for my personality.
* Currently have a software development practice. I've been CTO for hire for 3 startups.
* 2 apps in the google play store, more websites than you can count.
* I participate in a competitive coding website called codewars.com where I'm currently ranked 621 in the world out of somewhere between 200k and 300k users
* Right now my main day job is I'm the curriculum developer and director of technology at **Florida Vocational Institute.** I don't wanna plug too much but at FVI our mission is to teach the world to code, we want to empower people with hard skills in technology. I have taught coding to kids as young as 14 and all the way up to people near their 50s. I really believe that with my guidance and some persistence anyone can learn to code. 
* I was the IT director of Columbus High so I know what it is to deal with young students. I know your plight, and throughout this talk I will try to always bring it back to actionable things that can actually be applied in the classroom.
* Why do I tell you this? I'm about to sell you a lot of ideas and I wanna establish credibility.

###What is the goal of teaching something?

*Wait for answers*

In the more developed fields, we start by laying a foundation of stuff that was discovered forever ago. In math we start with numbers, counting, algebra, etc and build from there.

In newer fields like economics, we pretty much get to lay a brief foundation and then jump into telling our students about the consensus within one school of thought.

In ultra new fields like teaching Entrepreneurship, we can just dive straight into what the experts think.

**So, teaching entrepreneurship to me means relaying the lessons from the leading thinkers in the world of entrepreneurship. Good teaching means trying to influence how much the students learn, but we'll get more into that later**

Most of what I'll be doing with you today will pertain to the first half of what i just said: relaying the thinking of leading experts. I'll share some of the thoughts of entrepreneurship experts which I've found most useful and impactful to me and my career. 

I'll be sharing learning resources, book recommendations, and trying to give you a first pass, a high level overview about many entrepreneurship concepts as they relate to technology companies.

I'll touch on the pedagogical optimization a little bit but i have so much material to cover I don't know if we will have time.

##Zero to one

This book is a primer on how to conduct the ideation of your business and how to think like an entrepreneur. It focuses more on the visionary aspect and how to look at the world rather than how to execute in business (that's coming later).

My favorite excerpt from the book:
"Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business."

My favorite 3 concepts from the book:  

1. Build a platform (web 3.0). **Who is the biggest taxi company in the world?**  

2. Indefinite optimism, definite optimism, and pessimism, and how this relates to the notion that if you follow your passions, everything will be great (total fairy tale). I believe in statistics. I would much rather change my dreams from being a basketball player to being a coder than reach the top 10% of basketball players and have nothing to show for it. When you go into something you should always consider the probability of success. Of all the successful business owners I know personally... ALL of them started with an opportunity. A web design company that was closed and whose clients were there for the taking. A school that was profitable but in regulatory problems and so up for sale at a discount. An ESL academy which was closed due to cash flow missmanagement and all the students were left ripe for the picking.  

3. The seven questions a startup should ask itself  

####What makes a good business idea?

1. **The Engineering Question**:
Can you create breakthrough technology (vs. incremental improvement)? This is probably the most important concept. If your idea is a tiny incremental improvement that doesn't fundamentally change a market, its not worth starting a business over.

2. **The Timing Question**:
Is now the right time to start this particular business?

3. **The Monopoly Question**:
Are you starting with a big share of a small market? Beware of the trap of thinking "if we can just get 1% of this giant market..." This is why Uber goes into a city and they go really hard in there rather than trying to go nationwide. It becomes memetic.

4. **The People Question**:
Do you have the right team? This is a question I could give a whole talk on. When you're at the point in your career that you need to build a team, Patrick Lencioni's book "The Ideal Team Player" is a great place to start.

5. **The Distribution Question**:
Do you have a way to not just create but **deliver** your product? "If you build it they will come" was probably said by someone who never built anything.

6. **The Durability Question**:
Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?

7. **The Secret Question**:
Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see? The key here is contrarian thinking. Henry Ford found a secret. AirBNB found a secret. Uber found a secret. I have another secret: our models for testing are based on the restrictions imposed by paper. 

I believe we at FVI have found a secret as well. There is $1t of student loan debt and roughly half the people out there who take out loans stay stuck in poverty. People are holding on to the myth that college enables the american dream and sooner or later they will wake up. When they do, we will be ready.

##The Lean startup
The lean startup is a book about execution in business. The main crux of it is that **everything you ever do in business should be an experiment.** This book was what popularized the term "lean," and it has a pertty big and nuanced meaning.

The whole book is amazing and if I sit here and try to relay it to you I will do it no justice because I've only read it once. 

However the main takeaway from the book is that if you think from an epistemological standpoint, there is little to nothing which we **can** know. So when you go into business, assume you don't know anything and set out to test your assumptions as quickly and cheaply as you possibly can.

**Does anyone have a business idea here?** Let's talk about how one might iterate towards or just start researching the viability of this idea with a very low cost approach. (If no audience participation, talk about Focus.)

The Lean Startup book goes through tons of examples about disruptive thinking. It goes into a fair amount of detail about how Toyota disrupted the car world by rethinking distribution systems, rethinking their corporate team structure, and their manufacturing processes.

Another one of the biggest lessons given by the book pertains to the three engines of growth a modern company has:  
1. **The sticky engine:** Having zero customer attrition. Example: world of warcraft.  
2. **The viral engine:** Having built in mechanisms for your customers to be inadvertent advocates of your product and bring you tons of referrals. Example: hotmail.  
3. **The paid engine:** Take a modern approach to marketing and measure your customer acquisition cost, keep investing into the most profitable marketing means.

##Growth Hacker Marketing

This book is by one of my favorite authors and a very quick read. About 90 mins on audio. It's packed full of ideas similar to the lean startup but everything is stated differently and it has some different examples. 

In this book, ryan holiday creates a concept that puts a name to the process that they describe in the lean startup. The process of experimenting to test assumptions is called "finding product market fit."

A lot of marketers get stuck on "how do we reach our target market????"

The biggest takeaway from this book is that in the authors opinion, and I happen to strongly agree, if you are asking yourself that question then are you probably missing half the picture. It's much easier to throw stuff at the wall and find something that people will buy than it is to find people to buy something you have developed. Chances are nobody wants what you made because people's wants aren't infinite.

##Agile Development
So now I'm totally shifting gears. I think NFTE as a whole recognizes that software development is the thing right now. Technology companies are it. You can change the world and make billions with 20 coders in a big garage.

So I think it would be remiss of me to not talk about how all these business principles integrate into software development. 

In iterating towards product market fit, the way to do it is to create a minimum viable product that is good enough for people to buy. Dropbox did an explainer video and had like 500k people signed up to download before they ever even wrote a line of code.

This is where your engineering team comes in. The engineering leadership needs to be business minded and they need to help you quickly implement a minimum viable product. This is where agile development comes in. 

Agile development started as an alternative to planning. Before we had Agile, some astronomical percentage of software projects went unfinished. Companies spent months and sometimes years gathering requirements and planning away, but software is so complex it's impossible to plan. Planning software is like planning a conversation with a sales prospect, except you are selling a different product every time. You just can't plan that.

Healthcare.gov is an example of the catastrophic effect planning has on software. It exhibits the "waterfall" mentality.

So in short: Agile development is a methodology that tries to break down software projects into a series of features and only worry about implementing one feature at a time. The developers have weekly meetings and only plan as far as one week or one month - they just plan what they'll be implementing next. When you marry agile to lean, you get a solid business cranking out MVPs (minimum viable products) faster and faster and getting better at iterating towards success.

##Make it actionable for kids
Let's brainstorm some ideas on how we are going to trick kids into learning this.

1. Split them in teams and give an assignment to come up with an idea. Then make teams criticize each others' ideas through the lens of the seven questions, discuss it in class.  
2. Have them criticize a local business.  
3. Have them come up with a secret.  
4. Have them come up with a low or zero cost strategy to test their assumption.
